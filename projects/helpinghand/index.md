**HelpingHand** is an open-source social app/platform where you make friends by helping them. This was built for the purpose of submission to [HarperDB + Hashnode Hackathon 2021](https://townhall.hashnode.com/announcing-harperdb-hackathon-on-hashnode). The hackathon ran for the whole month of June '21, the submission was done with only 6 days of working both on the frontend and backend.

I have been continuing on with the development of the web app ever since. It's open source, so you can jump in and help with the development if you want to.
